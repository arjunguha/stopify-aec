A somewhat incomplete list of changes:

- Removed all the __main__ checks.
- Several benchmarks let me specify the number of iterations. I picked
  n-iters such that the benchmarks ran for a few seconds.
- Inlined super constructors in deltablue.py
- Wrote my own shim for time (Transcrypt's time only works in browser)
- Disabled saving output to file in raytrace-simple
- Inlined the file in schulze.py
- Changed pystone to use time.time() instead of time.clock()

Screwed up ATM:

CHAOS
gcbench
Schulze
