NOTE(arjun): These are compiled with PyJS, which took some major hacks.
Ask me for details if you're curious. However, I've verified that all benchmarks
run the same in Python and Node. Hopefully, any debugging can be done by
only examining the JavaScript output.


A somewhat incomplete list of changes:

- Removed all the __main__ checks.
- Several benchmarks let me specify the number of iterations. I picked
  n-iters such that the benchmarks ran for a few seconds.
- Inlined super constructors in deltablue.py
- Disabled saving output to file in raytrace-simple
- Inlined the file in schulze.py
- Changed pystone to use time.time() instead of time.clock()
- Removed all print statements
- Disabled use of string iterpolation for Transcrypt. No longer relevant for
  PyJS, I think.
- Messed with the number of iterations for several benchmarks.
