Modifications:

1. Run in a loop 5000 times.
2. Removed dependency on their benchmarking framework.
3. Output from ScalaJS requires webpack's shim for global, but Stopify's
   webpack configuration does not shim global. We could make the Webpack
   configuration a language-dependent parameter to Stopify, but this is a very
   boring detail.
