Summary of changes:

- Removed all the __main__ checks.
- Several benchmarks let me specify the number of iterations. I picked
  n-iters such that the benchmarks ran for a few seconds.
- Inlined super constructors in deltablue.py
- Disabled saving output to file in raytrace-simple
- Inlined the file in schulze.py
- Changed pystone to use time.time() instead of time.clock()
- Removed some print statements. We used to require no output, but this was
  a bad idea.
- Disabled use of string iterpolation for Transcrypt. No longer relevant for
  PyJS, but this change remains.
- Messed with the number of iterations for several benchmarks.
- Removed use of onload
