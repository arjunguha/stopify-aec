;; Unlike Christian Vosteen's C program, I will only use 6 directions:

;; (i.e. pieces whose shapes are like a tree, and cannot be
;; represented only with a sequence of directions from one starting
;; point).

;; at each position on the board. That's 10 pieces x 50 board

;; side down').  However, not all 6x2=12 rotations will fit on every
;; cell, so I'll have to keep count of the actual number that do.  The
;; pieces are going to be longs just like the board so they can be
;; bitwise-anded with the board to determine if they fit.  I'm also
;; going to record the next possible open cell for each piece and
